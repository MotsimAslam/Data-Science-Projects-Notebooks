## Project 1: Dive into visualization with Seaborn Library iris flower
## Iris Dataset Summary:
- The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. It consists of measurements of various features of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. Each sample consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

- The goal of the dataset is to classify iris flowers based on these features. It serves as a fundamental dataset for practicing classification algorithms and exploring data visualization techniques. The Iris dataset is widely used in introductory machine learning courses, benchmarking algorithms, and exploring techniques for data analysis and visualization.
